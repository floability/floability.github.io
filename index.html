<b><i>Floability</i></b> makes it easy to run complex workflows on clusters via notebooks.

A complete workflow is captured in a <b>floability backpack</b> which contains:
<ul>
  <li> A notebook describing the overall workflow.
  <li> The software environment needed by the workflow.
  <li> The datasets needed to run the workflow.
  <li> The cluster resources needed to run the workflow.
</ul>

Floability builds on a variety of open source technologies, including <a href=jupyter.org>Jupyter</a> to provide interactive notebook environments, <a href=https://facsrv.cs.depaul.edu/~tmalik1/#projects>SciUnit</a> to discover software and data dependencies, <a href=https://ccl.cse.nd.edu/software/taskvine/>TaskVine</a>to express and execute workflows, and <a href=https://conda-forge.org>Conda Forge</a> to provision and deploy software environments.
