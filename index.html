<p>
The <b>Floability Project</b> is an NSF funded research project to enable the rapid
and portable deployment of notebooks expressing complex scientific workflows across
a wide range of cyberinfrastructure.  The key technical challenge is that
<b>workflows are incomplete</b>: the code by itself cannot be moved between facilities
without accurately capturing the software dependencies, required datasets,
and capabilities of the underlying cluster hardware.  Our research team at
the University of Notre Dame, the University of Missouri-Columbia, and the University of Illinois
is developing solutions to discover, express, and deploy the complete set of
dependencies needed for complex scientific workflows.

Floability builds on a variety of open source technologies, including <a href=jupyter.org>Jupyter</a> to provide interactive notebook environments, <a href=https://cdmdicewebprd01.dpu.depaul.edu/projects/advancedcontainers/>Sciunit</a> to discover software and data dependencies, <a href=https://ccl.cse.nd.edu/software/taskvine/>TaskVine</a> to express and execute workflows, and <a href=https://conda-forge.org>Conda Forge</a> to provision and deploy software environments.
